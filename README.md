# IPL Mini Project

## Overview

This project provides comprehensive data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) T20 matches, covering all seasons from 2008 to 2020. It explores the evolution of teams, players, match outcomes, and key trends using ball-by-ball and match-level datasets. The project leverages Python and popular data science libraries for insightful visualizations and statistical insights.[1]

## Features

- Analysis of IPL matches, teams, and player performances from 2008 to 2020.[1]
- Season-wise match and run statistics, including highs, lows, and trends.[1]
- Comprehensive breakdowns of:
  - Team dominance, title wins, and toss analysis.[1]
  - Batsman and bowler highlights (top run-scorers, 4s, 6s, wicket-takers, strike rates).[1]
  - Venue analysis, “lucky” venues by team, and venue impacts.[1]
  - Outcome analysis: impact of toss decisions, chasing vs. defending wins.[1]
- Boundary and over-specific scoring analyses (powerplays, death overs).[1]
- Visualization of trends: runs per season, matches per season, strike rates, and more.[1]
- Discussion of limitations and proposed future extensions (e.g. updates, predictive modeling, sentiment analysis).[1]

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure IPO dataset files (matches and ball-by-ball) are available in your working directory.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Jupyter Notebook or directly as a Python file:
   ```sh
   python ipl_mini_project.py
   ```
3. **Outputs**: The script will process the data, generate detailed plots, and print insights about teams, players, and trends in IPL history.[1]

## Structure

- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Matches played per season
  - Runs scored per season
  - Team and player achievements
  - Toss impact, winning trends, and match results
  - Special segment breakdowns (first 6 overs, last 4 overs, venue-wise patterns)
- Visualization of all statistics
- Conclusions, limitations, and directions for future work

## Main Insights

- Teams like Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have shown consistent dominance.[1]
- Key players are highlighted for batting and bowling excellence over the years.[1]
- Venue and toss choices significantly impact outcomes; recent years show higher batting strike rates.[1]
- Recommendations for future enhancements include predictive analytics and dashboard creation.[1]

## Limitations

- Analysis only covers up to the 2020 IPL season.
- External factors like injuries or strategies are not deeply integrated.
- Fielding and advanced metrics are limited by data structure.[1]

## Future Scope

- Extend to data for IPL 2021 and beyond
- Add predictive models and interactive dashboards
- Incorporate real-time insights and social sentiment analysis.[1]
